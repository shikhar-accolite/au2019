The company has seen a lot of people leave the company recently and they would like to understand why that's happening. They have collected historical data on employees and they would like you to build a model that is able to predict which employee will leave next. The would like a model that is better than random guessing. They also prefer false negatives than false positives, in this first phase. Fields in the dataset include:

- Employee satisfaction level
- Last evaluation
- Number of projects
- Average monthly hours
- Time spent at the company
- Whether they have had a work accident
- Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
- Department
- Salary
- Whether the employee has left

Your goal is to predict the binary outcome variable `left` using the rest of the data. Since the outcome is binary, this is a classification problem. Here are some things you may want to try out:

1. load the dataset at ../data/HR_comma_sep.csv, inspect it with `.head()`, `.info()` and `.describe()`.
- Establish a benchmark: what would be your accuracy score if you predicted everyone stay?
- Check if any feature needs rescaling. You may plot a histogram of the feature to decide which rescaling method is more appropriate.
- convert the categorical features into binary dummy columns. You will then have to combine them with the numerical features using `pd.concat`.
- do the usual train/test split with a 20% test size
- play around with learning rate and optimizer
- check the confusion matrix, precision and recall
- check if you still get the same results if you use a 5-Fold cross validation on all the data


2. Apply deep learning techniques to this data and see if the result improves
